FoodLogoDet-1500 Dataset Description
----
Food logo detection plays an important role in the multimedia for its wide real-world applications, such as food recommendation of
the self-service shop and infringement detection on e-commerce platforms. A large-scale food logo dataset is urgently needed for developing
advanced food logo detection algorithms. However, there
are no available food logo datasets with food brand information.
To support efforts towards food logo detection, we introduce the
dataset FoodLogoDet-1500, a newlarge-scale publicly available food
logo dataset, which has 1,500 categories, about 100,000 images and
about 150,000 manually annotated food logo objects.We describe
the collection and annotation process of FoodLogoDet-1500, analyze
its scale and diversity, and compare it with other logo datasets.
To the best of our knowledge, FoodLogoDet-1500 is the first largest
publicly available high-quality dataset for food logo detection.
